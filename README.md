### **6. Connect AWS to Django for Static and Media Files**

<details>
<summary><strong>Connecting AWS S3 to Django</strong></summary>

- **Install Necessary Packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install boto3 django-storages
    ```

- **Update `settings.py`**:
    - Add `'storages'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in **settings.py**.

    if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
        AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'fitflex-static-media'
        AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your-region'
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
        AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
    ```

- **Create Custom Storage Classes**:
    - Create a new file in your project root called `custom_storages.py`, and define the storage classes:
    ```python
    from django.conf import settings
    from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

    class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

    class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
    ```

- **Define Storage Locations**:
    - In **settings.py**, within the `USE_AWS` condition, add the following:
    ```python
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'



    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
    ```

- **Upload Static and Media Files**:
