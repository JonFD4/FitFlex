# Design
## Modeling and Wireframing
## Agile Methodology

To track steps and milestone in this project development, agile methodology was used. User stories detailing what the customer and shop owner needs along was broken down into the parent user stories and individual tasks that represent the acceptance criteria.
[Project board](https://github.com/users/JonFD4/projects/4)

[Wireframes](ReadmeImages/wireframes) were also created to give a rough idea of what the site is suposed to look like but also the functionalities that were not customised.


![Database model](ReadmeImages/dbmodel.png) designed using [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d)


### 1. **FAQ Model**
- **Usage**: Stores frequently asked questions along with answers. It helps administrators manage common user queries.
- **Relation**: Connected to `UserQuestion` through the `faq` field. If a user’s question is answered, it links back to an FAQ entry.

### 2. **UserQuestion Model**
- **Usage**: Stores questions submitted by users. Admins can review and map them to an FAQ if needed.
- **Relation**: Linked to `FAQ` (if the user’s question is answered). This relationship allows the user’s questions to be mapped to the corresponding FAQ.

### 3. **WorkoutCategory Model**
- **Usage**: Categorizes workout programs (e.g., "Home" or "Gym").
- **Relation**: Each `WorkoutProgram` belongs to one `WorkoutCategory`, helping users filter programs by type.

### 4. **DifficultyLevel Model**
- **Usage**: Defines different difficulty levels for workout programs (e.g., "Beginner", "Advanced").
- **Relation**: Each `WorkoutProgram` is assigned one `DifficultyLevel`, making it easier for users to choose a program based on their fitness level.

### 5. **WorkoutProgram Model**
- **Usage**: Represents a workout program with details like name, description, price, and duration. Users can explore, purchase, and follow workout programs.
- **Relation**: 
  - Linked to `WorkoutCategory` (categorizing the program).
  - Linked to `DifficultyLevel` (indicating the program's difficulty).
  - Connected to `Review` (users can leave feedback on workout programs).

### 6. **Review Model**
- **Usage**: Allows users to rate and comment on workout programs. Reviews help other users decide which programs to follow.
- **Relation**: 
  - Associated with `WorkoutProgram` (each review is tied to a specific program).
  - Linked to `User` (each review is written by a user).

### 7. **UserProfile Model**
- **Usage**: Stores additional user details like default name and email. It extends the default `User` model for extra customisation.
- **Relation**: Linked to the built-in `User` model via a one-to-one relationship, meaning each user has a unique profile.


### Key Relationships

- **One-to-Many**: 
  - A `WorkoutCategory` can have many `WorkoutProgram`s.
  - A `DifficultyLevel` can have many `WorkoutProgram`s.
  - A `WorkoutProgram` can have many `Review`s.
  - A `User` can have many `Review`s.

- **Many-to-One**:
  - A `UserQuestion` can refer to one `FAQ`, if answered.
  - A `Review` refers to one `WorkoutProgram` and one `User`.

- **One-to-One**:
  - A `User` has one `UserProfile`, with personalised user information.

        AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'fitflex-static-media'
        AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'your-region'
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
        AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
    ```

- **Create Custom Storage Classes**:
    - Create a new file in your project root called `custom_storages.py`, and define the storage classes:
    ```python
    from django.conf import settings
    from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

    class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

    class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
        location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
    ```

- **Define Storage Locations**:
    - In **settings.py**, within the `USE_AWS` condition, add the following:
    ```python
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'



    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
    ```

- **Upload Static and Media Files**:
    - Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to upload your static files to S3.
    - Upload any media files (such as product images) directly to S3 in the `media` folder.
